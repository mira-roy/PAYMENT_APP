                    <p>UMEED, India’s most trusted NGO, has been working towards visually challenged education,
                        training,
                        employment, livelihood and support services for more than 35 years. Thanks to the support of
                        people
                        like you, we’ve impacted over 30000+ visually challenged in India

                        But we have miles to go and need your help. India is home to a third of the world’s blind
                        population. The country has about 12 million individuals with visual impairment as against the
                        global total of 39 million. Despite this, when it comes to accessibility of education,
                        healthcare
                        and employment, the visually impaired are cut-off. Only 29.16 percent of the blind in India are
                        part
                        of the education system as per a survey conducted by the (NCERT). The same survey points out
                        that
                        only 6.86 percent of schools have access to braille books and audio content.

                        Donate to UMEED to give visually challenged a confidence in them for their future. Your small
                        contribution will make a big difference in their lives.
